# 2D Gaussian Splatting Colab

This project provides a Google Colab implementation of the original reference implementation for [2D Gaussian Splatting for Geometrically Accurate Radiance Fields (SIGGRAPH 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17888) to facilitate **rapid prototyping** of 2DGS scenes using cloud compute.

## How to Use

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/atakan-topaloglu/2d-gaussian-splatting/blob/main/2d_gaussian_splatting.ipynb#scrollTo=Iu5nIIrEY1_n )

1. Upload your COLMAP or NERF Synthetic dataset to Google Drive.
2. Launch the 2DGS Colab Notebook.
3. Execute the training and rendering process.
4. Download the generated output folder from Google Drive.
5. Run [SIBR Viewer for viewing 2DGS](https://github.com/hbb1/2d-gaussian-splatting?tab=readme-ov-file#sibr-viewer) locally to view the outputs.
